The 'heroku/nodejs' buildpack is set on this application, but was
unable to detect a 'package.json' file. This is likely because
the '.slugignore' file is removing it before the build begins.

Application not supported by 'heroku/nodejs' buildpack

The 'heroku/nodejs' buildpack is set on this application, but was
unable to detect a Node.js codebase.
    
A Node.js app on Heroku requires a 'package.json' at the root of
the directory structure.

If you are trying to deploy a Node.js application, ensure that this
file is present at the top level directory. This directory has the
following files:

$(ls -1p "$1")
    
If you are trying to deploy an application written in another
language, you need to change the list of buildpacks set on your
Heroku app using the 'heroku buildpacks' command.
    
For more information, refer to the following documentation:
