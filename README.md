This is the official [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Node.js apps.

## Documentation

For more information about using this Node.js buildpack on Heroku, see these Dev Center articles:

- [Getting Started with Node.js on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs)
- [Troubleshooting Node.js Deploys](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/troubleshooting-node-deploys)

- [Buildpack API](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpack-api)

## Using the Heroku Node.js buildpack

It's suggested that you use the latest version of the release buildpack. You can set it using the `heroku-cli`.

```sh
heroku buildpacks:set heroku/nodejs
```

Your builds will always used the latest published release of the buildpack.

If you need to use the git url, you can use the `latest` tag to make sure you always have the latest release. **The `main` branch will always have the latest buildpack updates, but it does not correspond with a numbered release.**

```sh
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#latest -a my-app
```

## Locking to a buildpack version

Even though it's suggested to use the latest release, you may want to lock dependencies - including buildpacks - to a specific version.

First, find the version you want from
[the list of buildpack versions](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/releases).
Then, specify that version with `buildpacks:set`:

```
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#v176 -a my-app
```

### Chain Node with multiple buildpacks

This buildpack automatically exports node, npm, and any node_modules binaries
into the `$PATH` for easy use in subsequent buildpacks.

## Development

### Prerequisites

For local development, you may need the following tools:

- [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/search?type=edition&offering=community)
- [Go 1.14](https://golang.org/doc/install#install)
- [upx](https://upx.github.io/)

### Deploying an app with a fork or branch

To make changes to this buildpack, fork it on GitHub.
Push up changes to your fork, then create a new Heroku app to test it,
or configure an existing app to use your buildpack:

```
# Create a new Heroku app that uses your buildpack
heroku create --buildpack <your-github-url>

# Configure an existing Heroku app to use your buildpack
heroku buildpacks:set <your-github-url>

# You can also use a git branch!
heroku buildpacks:set <your-github-url>#your-branch
```

### Downloading Plugins

In order to download the latest plugins that have been released, run the following:

```
plugin/download.sh v$VERSION
```

Make sure the version is in the format `v#`, ie. `v7`.

## Tests

The buildpack tests use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to simulate
Heroku's stacks.

To run the test suite:

```
make test
```

Or to just test a specific stack:

```
make heroku-18-build
make heroku-20-build
make heroku-22-build
```

The tests are run via the vendored
[shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2)
test framework.

### Debugging

To display the logged build outputs to assist with debugging, use the "echo" and "cat" commands. For example:

```sh
test() {
  local log_file var

  var="testtest"
  log_file=$(mktemp)
  echo "this is the log file" > "$log_file"
  echo "test log file" >> "$log_file"

  # use `echo` and `cat` for printing variables and reading files respectively
  echo $var
  cat $log_file

  # some cases when debugging is necessary
  assertEquals "$var" "testtest"
  assertFileContains "test log file" "$log_file"
}
```

Running the test above would produce:

```log
testtest
this is the log file
test log file
```

The test output writes to `$STD_OUT`, so you can use `cat $STD_OUT` to read output.
