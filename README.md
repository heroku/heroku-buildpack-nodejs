This is the official [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Node.js apps. If you fork this repository, please **update this README** to explain what your fork does and why it's special.

## Documentation

For more information about using Node.js and buildpacks on Heroku, see these Dev Center articles:

## Locking to a buildpack version

In production, you frequently want to lock all of your dependencies - including
buildpacks - to a specific version. That way, you can regularly update and
test them, upgrading with confidence.

First, find the version you want from [the list of buildpack versions](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs/releases).
Then, specify that version with `buildpacks:set`:

```
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs#v75 -a my-app
```

If you have trouble upgrading to the latest version of the buildpack, please
open a support ticket at [help.heroku.com](https://help.heroku.com/) so we can assist.

## Options

### Specify a node version

Set engines.node in package.json to the semver range
(or specific version) of node you'd like to use.
(It's a good idea to make this the same version you use during development)

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "0.11.x"
}
```

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "0.10.33"
}
```

Default: the
[latest stable version.](http://semver.io/node)

### Specify an npm version

Set engines.npm in package.json to the semver range
(or specific version) of npm you'd like to use.
(It's a good idea to make this the same version you use during development)

Since 'npm 2' shipped several major bugfixes, you might try:

```json
"engines": {
  "npm": "2.x"
}
```

```json
"engines": {
  "npm": "^2.1.0"
}
```

Default: the version of npm bundled with your node install (varies).

### Enable or disable node_modules caching

For a 'clean' build without using any cached node modules:

```shell
heroku config:set NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false
git commit -am 'rebuild' --allow-empty
git push heroku master
heroku config:unset NODE_MODULES_CACHE
```

Caching node_modules between builds dramatically speeds up build times.
However, `npm install` doesn't automatically update already-installed modules
as long as they fall within acceptable semver ranges,
which can lead to outdated modules.

Default: `NODE_MODULES_CACHE` defaults to true

### Enable or disable devDependencies installation

During local development, `npm install` installs all dependencies
and all devDependencies (test frameworks, build tools, etc).
This is usually something you want to avoid in production, so
npm has a 'production' config that can be set through the environment:

To install *dependencies only:*

```shell
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=true
```

To install *dependencies and devDependencies:*

```shell
heroku config:set NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION=false
```

If `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`, your devDependencies will be pruned after running `npm install`.

Default: `NPM_CONFIG_PRODUCTION` defaults to true on Heroku

### Configure npm with .npmrc

Sometimes, a project needs custom npm behavior to set up proxies,
use a different registry, etc. For such behavior,
just include an `.npmrc` file in the root of your project:

```
# .npmrc
registry = 'https://custom-registry.com/'
```

### Reasonable defaults for concurrency

This buildpack adds two environment variables: `WEB_MEMORY` and `WEB_CONCURRENCY`.
You can set either of them, but if unset the buildpack will fill them with reasonable defaults.

- `WEB_MEMORY`: expected memory use by each node process (in MB, default: 512)
- `WEB_CONCURRENCY`: recommended number of processes to Cluster based on the current environment

Clustering is not done automatically; concurrency should be part of the app,
usually via a library like [throng](https://github.com/hunterloftis/throng).
Apps without any clustering mechanism will remain unaffected by these variables.

This behavior allows your app to automatically take advantage of larger containers.
The default settings will cluster
1 process on a 1X dyno, 2 processes on a 2X dyno, and 12 processes on a PX dyno.

For example, when your app starts:

```
app[web.1]: Detected 1024 MB available memory, 512 MB limit per process (WEB_MEMORY)
app[web.1]: Recommending WEB_CONCURRENCY=2
app[web.1]:
app[web.1]: > example-concurrency@1.0.0 start /app
app[web.1]: > node server.js
app[web.1]: Listening on 51118
app[web.1]: Listening on 51118
```

Notice that on a 2X dyno, the
[example concurrency app](https://github.com/heroku-examples/node-concurrency)
listens on two processes concurrently.

### Chain Node with multiple buildpacks

This buildpack automatically exports node, npm, and any node_modules binaries
into the `$PATH` for easy use in subsequent buildpacks.

## Hacking

To make changes to this buildpack, fork it on Github. Push up changes to your fork, then create a new Heroku app to test it, or configure an existing app to use your buildpack:

```
# Create a new Heroku app that uses your buildpack
heroku create --buildpack <your-github-url>

# Configure an existing Heroku app to use your buildpack
heroku buildpacks:set <your-github-url>

# You can also use a git branch!
heroku buildpacks:set <your-github-url>#your-branch
```

## Testing

The buildpack tests use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to simulate
Heroku's Cedar and Cedar-14 containers.

To run the test suite:

```
make test
```

Or to just test in cedar or cedar-14:

```
make test-cedar-10
make test-cedar-14
```

The tests are run via the vendored [shunit2](http://shunit2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/source/2.1/doc/shunit2.html)
test framework.
